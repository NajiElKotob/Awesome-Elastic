"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 
Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing 
pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then 
sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack
